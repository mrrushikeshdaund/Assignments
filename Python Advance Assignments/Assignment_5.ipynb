This is contrary to the single inheritance property, which allows an object or class to inherit from one specific object or class. Although there are certain benefits associated with multiple inheritance, it does increase ambiguity and complexity when not designed or implemented properly"],"metadata":{"id":"p1hkgjtuGGOH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2 What is the concept of delegation?"],"metadata":{"id":"wDlwSrJXGReI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Delegation is an object oriented technique (also called a design pattern). Let's say you have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. You can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method you're interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x.\n","\n","- Python programmers can easily implement delegation. For example, the following class implements a class that behaves like a file but converts all written data to uppercase:"],"metadata":{"id":"zvUsyDNAGUsX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3 What is the concept of composition?"],"metadata":{"id":"AfLHjwtFGlIY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Inheritance and composition are two major concepts in object oriented programming that model the relationship between two classes. They drive the design of an application and determine how the application should evolve as new features are added or requirements change.\n","- Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component. This relationship means that a Composite has a Component."],"metadata":{"id":"mzky5nS8Gonn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q4 What are bound methodsÂ and how do we use them?"],"metadata":{"id":"EAXA9zB7G2yX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument.

If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method won't interfere with other names in the tree, especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios: class Super"],"metadata":{"id":"GSR7QlyGHNM_"}}]}
