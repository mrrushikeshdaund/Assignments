For example, if you have a string \"hello\", you cannot change the character 'e' to 'a' to make it \"hallo\".\n","\n","- When you try to assign a value to a string's indexed character, such as \"hello\"[1] = 'a', Python will raise a TypeError with a message like \" 'str' object does not support item assignment\". This is because strings do not support item assignment due to their immutability.\n","\n","- However, you can create a new string with the desired change by slicing and concatenating the original string with the new value.
