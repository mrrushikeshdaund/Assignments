The value of this attribute should be a class that inherits from type\n","\n","- Using the metaclass argument: In Python 3, you can declare a class's metaclass by passing a metaclass argument to the class definition.

Class decorators are applied to the class definition itself, rather than to the metaclass. They are often used to add functionality to a class without modifying its inheritance hierarchy, or to provide a cleaner syntax for defining complex classes.\n","\n","- Metaclasses, on the other hand, are used to modify the behavior of all classes that are instances of a particular metaclass. They are used to define the behavior of a class at the time of its creation, rather than after the fact. They can be used to enforce constraints on class definitions, add or modify class attributes, or implement custom inheritance models.\n","\n","- In some cases, class decorators and metaclasses can be used together to achieve more complex behavior. For example, you might define a metaclass that uses a class decorator to modify the behavior of each class it creates. Or you might use a class decorator to add behavior to a class that is defined using a custom metaclass.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5rbHHIa3fqSj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q4.

While they have some similarities, they have different use cases and some important differences when it comes to handling instances.\n","\n","- Class decorators are typically used to modify the behavior of class instances indirectly, by adding behavior to the class itself. When a class decorator is applied to a class, it is usually modifying the way that instances of that class behave, rather than modifying the instances themselves.\n","\n","- Metaclasses, on the other hand, can be used to modify the behavior of instances directly, by controlling how they are created and initialized. When you define a custom metaclass, you have the ability to modify the way that new instances of that class are created, including how their attributes are initialized and how they are registered with the rest of the program.\n","\n","- In general, class decorators are used to modify the behavior of classes and their attributes, while metaclasses are used to modify the behavior of classes and their instances.
