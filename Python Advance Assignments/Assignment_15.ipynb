It is called \"monkey patching\" because it involves making changes to a live object, which is similar to a monkey making changes to its surroundings.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XWqIlZiGzNCO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3.

The difference between these two types of copies lies in how they handle mutable objects such as lists or dictionaries.\n","\n","- A shallow copy creates a new object but does not create a new copy of nested objects. Instead, it references the same nested objects as the original object. Therefore, if you modify a nested object in the copied object, the original object will also be modified. Shallow copies can be created using the copy() method or the slice operator [:]"],"metadata":{"id":"L5CZigPF0SBY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q4. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?"],"metadata":{"id":"tYTGVr9S0WCu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- the maximum length of an identifier is technically unlimited. However, it is generally recommended to keep identifier names reasonably short and descriptive. PEP 8, the official Python style guide, recommends limiting identifier names to 79 characters or less.\n","\n","- In practical terms, the maximum length of an identifier is limited by the memory available in the computer running the Python interpreter. Very long identifier names can also make code difficult to read and maintain, so it's generally best to keep identifier names reasonably short and descriptive.\n","\n","- It's worth noting that Python identifiers must follow certain naming conventions, such as starting with a letter or underscore and consisting only of letters, numbers, and underscores. Python also has a number of reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers, such as if, else, and while."],"metadata":{"id":"zeWigQx10f9m"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q5.
