Here are the main differences between indexing and slicing:\n","\n","  - Indexing refers to accessing a single element in a sequence by its position or index. The index is an integer value that specifies the position of the element in the sequence, starting from 0 for the first element. Indexing is done using square brackets and the index of the element you want to access, for example, my_list[0] to access the first element of a list my_list.\n","\n","  - Slicing refers to accessing a contiguous sequence of elements in a sequence. A slice is specified by two indices, the start index and the stop index, separated by a colon. The start index is inclusive, while the stop index is exclusive, which means that the slice includes all elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. Slicing is also done using square brackets, for example, my_list[1:4] to slice a list my_list"],"metadata":{"id":"7GoYCTQBWJ5N"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q5.

For example, my_list[4:1:-1] will return a new list containing the elements at indices 4, 3, and 2, in that order."],"metadata":{"id":"NChKOcazWZQo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q6.
