In this case, the difference between greedy and non-greedy matching is clear.\n","\n","- However, if there is only one match available that satisfies the pattern, the difference between greedy and non-greedy matching may not matter. In this case, using a greedy pattern would simply match as much text as possible, while using a non-greedy pattern would match the same text, but with less effort.\n","\n","- If you are looking for a non-greedy match, but the only match available is greedy, you may need to modify the pattern or the input string to force a non-greedy match. One option is to use a non-greedy quantifier or to add a question mark after a greedy quantifier.
