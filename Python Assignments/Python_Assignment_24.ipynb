Conciseness: lambda expressions provide a compact way to define simple functions that can be used in functional programming constructs.

Anonymous functions: lambda expressions can be used to define anonymous functions that can be used in a single context, without the need to give them a name.\n","\n","3. Function as argument: lambda expressions can be passed as arguments to other functions, making it easy to define functions on the fly and use them in higher-order functions.\n","\n","4. Improved readability: When used correctly, lambda expressions can make the code more readable by making it clear what a function is doing and reducing the amount of boilerplate code.\n","\n","5.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Functions should not contain duplicated code, and common functionality should be encapsulated in a single function that can be called from multiple places.\n","\n","5. Input Validation: Functions should validate their inputs to ensure that they receive the correct data type, size, and format, and return appropriate error messages when the inputs are invalid.\n","\n","6. Error Handling: Functions should handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages or exceptions, instead of crashing or producing incorrect results.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JyiTQvdwkI-Z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q7.

Exceptions: Functions can raise exceptions to indicate errors or exceptional conditions.

Output parameters: Functions can communicate results to the caller by modifying one or more output parameters. Output parameters are passed as references to objects, and any changes made to these objects will be reflected in the caller's scope.\n","\n","5.
