This is the most common use case for list comprehensions in Python, as it allows you to build a list of elements based on a set of conditions or operations. \n"," \n","2. A list comprehension enclosed in parentheses () creates a generator expression, which is an object that generates values one by one as they are requested, instead of creating all the values up front.

A generator is a special type of function that uses the yield statement to return a value, instead of the return statement.

Generators are automatically iterators, as they implement these methods and can be used in the same way as any other iterator.\n","\n","- The main advantage of using generators is that they can generate elements one at a time, on demand, instead of generating all the elements up front.

When a function containing a yield statement is called, it returns a generator object, but it does not execute the function code. Instead, execution is paused and resumed each time next() is called on the generator object, allowing the function to produce a series of values \"lazily\", that is, only when they are needed. This allows the generator function to efficiently produce a large series of values without the need to generate all of them in memory at once."],"metadata":{"id":"JkZkHlfdnG41"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions?

However, there are some differences between the two:\n","\n","2. Syntax: map() is a built-in Python function that takes two or more arguments: a function and one or more iterables. A list comprehension, on the other hand, uses a more concise syntax that includes the function and the iterable within square brackets.\n","\n","3. Readability: List comprehensions can often be more readable than map() calls, especially for simple functions, because the function and the iterable are written in one line.\n","\n","4. Lazy evaluation: map() returns a map object, which is a lazy iterable. This means that the values in the map object are only generated when they are needed. On the other hand, a list comprehension generates a list object, which is a materialized list that contains all of its elements in memory.\n","\n","5. Performance: Because list comprehensions generate a materialized list, they can be slower than map() calls when generating very large lists. On the other hand, map() can be slower than list comprehensions for small lists, because it must create an additional object"],"metadata":{"id":"UQ5_M2EfnMqf"}}]}
